# CodeInPlace2021
This is a final project for Code in Place 2021, offered by Stanford University. The code is for a Caterpillar Game.
This program is a Caterpiller Game which begins when you hit the 'Space' button in your keyboard. 
The game has a Caterpiller which is rectangular shaped and black in color.
The main aim is to eat the leaf which is green color object in the screen by using your controls (left, right, up, down). 
By eating leaf, the Caterpiller increases in size, its speed increases and also your score increases, but if you run into any of the walls your game is over.
